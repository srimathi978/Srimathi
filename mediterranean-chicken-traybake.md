# Mediterranean chicken traybake

- Serves: 2
- Prep Time: 5 minutes
- Cook Time: 45 minutes
- Total Time: 50 minutes

## Ingredients

- 300g chicken thighs
- 300g tomatoes, roughly chopped
- 1 pepper, sliced
- 1/2 red onion, cut into 8 wedges through the root
- 1 clove, garlic, sliced as needed
- dried oregano, or any dried herb from the cupboard
- 125g Italian mozzarella, sliced
- 25g black olives, pitted to taste
- (optional) roasted potatoes or crusty bread, to serve
- (optional) salad

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/180°C fan.
2. Put the chicken thighs (300 g) into a 25 cm square ovenproof dish, drizzle with olive oil and season. Cook in the oven for 10 minutes.
3. Remove the chicken from the oven and add the tomatoes, peppers, onion, and garlic to the roasting tin. Drizzle with olive oil, toss to coat, then sprinkle with the oregano (as needed) and some salt and pepper. Put the tray back into the oven for 15 minutes.
4. Remove the tray from the oven again. Lay the mozzarella on top, then scatter over the olives. Bake for another 20 minutes, until the chicken is cooked, the onions have charred, and the cheese is bubbling, then serve with roast potatoes (to taste) or crusty bread and some salad (to taste), if you like.
