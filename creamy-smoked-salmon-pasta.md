# Creamy smoked salmon pasta

Smoked salmon, one of my favourite fishes. Apparently my SO thinks I perfected this recipe. Possibly thanks to my brother, who after speaking with during cooking the recipe suggested I add a couple of teaspoons of whole grain mustard. 

- Serves: 2
- Prep Time: 5 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes
- Total Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 smoked salmon fillets
- 2 shallots, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, crushed
- 250g farfalle pasta
- 100ml double cream
- 2 tsp whole grain mustard
- Fresh chives, finely chopped, for garnish
- Fresh parsley, finely chopped, for garnish
- Seasoning, to taste

## Method

1. Cook the pasta as per the packets instructions.
2. Cook the salmon fillets skin down until crispy.
3. In the same pan fry of the shallot and garlic.
4. Add two teaspoons of mustard.
5. Mix in the cream and flake up the salmon.
6. Use a spaghetti spatula to drain the pasta before gradually adding some of the water from the pan to the salmon.
7. Mix the pasta with the salmon and sauce.
8. If it looks a little dry add some more of the pasta water.
7. Serve with freshly chopped parsley and a sprinkle of sea salt.
