- Cook Time: 30 minutes
- Total Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- Haggis
- Potatoes
-  Swede/Neeps
- 100g Salted Butter
- 100ml Milk - We use full fat
- Seasoning to taste

## Method

### Haggis

1. Follow the instructions on the Haggis you’ve chosen for your meal. 

### Neeps and Tatties

1. Fill both saucepans half full of water, adding a pinch of salt to both
2. Peel the potatoes and swede
3. Chop the potatoes roughly into quarters and the Swede into small cubes
4. Once the water is boiling add the potatoes to one pan and the swede to the other.
5. Boil for 20-30mins or until you can easily slide a knife into either.
6. Drain the potatoes, season and allow them to release any steam.
7. Drain the neeps and also allow to steam.
8. Add 50g Butter and 50g Milk to the potatoes.
9. Mash potatoes until creamy and all lumps have been removed.
10. Taste for seasoning, stir more in if required.
11. Add 50g butter to the Swede and roughly mash, leaving some rough texture to balance the creamy texture of the potatoes. 
12. Serve both while hot with the haggis.

### How to build your Haggis, Neeps and Tatties Stack with a Steel Ring

1. Place your ring on the plate you wish to serve on
2. Add a layer of haggis, filling roughly a third of the ring or 1 inch.
3. Push down on the haggis using the back of a spoon to make sure it’s firm.
4. Repeat this with the neeps and then the tatties.
5. Carefully slide off the ring, using the back of your spoon to ease the ring up without losing the shape of the stack.
