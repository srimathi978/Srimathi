# Chicken broth soup

My take on a classic. This recipe is inspired by a close family friend (her special Jewish recipe) and a Bosnian variation. It is a trusted favourite when I'm feeling poorly or unwell. Best served with semolina dumplings however I'm still perfecting these. If there is any leftover I drain and remove any remaining chicken (freeze for pie mix) and discard any veg. This leaves a delicate chicken broth for lunch the following day.

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 45 minutes
- Total Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

- 2 onions, halved and skin on
- 4 carrots, quartered and skin on
- 4 celery sticks, halved
- 4 garlic cloves, squashed
- 1l chicken stock
- Whole free-range chicken
- Fresh parsley, chopped to serve
- Seasoning, to taste

## Method

1. Add the onions, carrots, celery, garlic, stock and whole chicken to then pan and then fill with water.
1. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 45 hours
1. [Optional] Skim the fat and any foam from the top into a dish (this fat is great to keep refrigerated and use to cook with roast potatoes).
1. Drain over sieve into another pan.
1. Place the veg and chicken in the sieve to one side and return the broth back to the original pan.
1. Separate the chicken and vegetables. 
1. Remove the chicken from the carcass, carefully removing all the bones and skin (some clean marigolds can help with the heat).
1. Keep the chicken pieces for serving.
1. [Optional] This step can be skipped but I like to add the bones back to the broth (in a steamer basket for ease of removal) and simmer for a further 30 minutes.
1. [Optional] Continue to skim any fat or foam to create a delicate and clear broth.
1. If serving with dumplings then add them approximately 20 minutes ahead of serving.
1. Before serving, add chicken pieces to a bowl before pouring in the hot chicken broth and finishing with some chopped fresh parsley.
