# Green pea chowder

This recipe is one of my favourites. It’s so simple with a delicious result in under 20 minutes. It has a beautiful colour with a nourishingly filling flavour. It’s said to be best served piping hot in the early days of winter accompanied with a garlic bread, however I think this soup is great all year round. To add a refreshing twist try serving chilled.
