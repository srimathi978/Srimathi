- Serves: 2
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 15 minutes
- Total Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients

### For the marinade

- 1 tsp cornflour
- ¼ tsp baking soda
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp vegetable oil
- 2 Sirloin steak, trimmed of fat and sliced thin against the grain

### For the sauce

- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 110ml oyster sauce
- 110ml chicken stock
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp light brown sugar
- 2 tsp cornflour

### For the stir fry

- 3 tbsp vegetable oil
- 3 onions, cut into wedges
- 300g broccoli florets
- 1 medium carrot, peeled and cut into match sticks
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tbsp ginger, grated
- ¼ tsp crushed chillies
- Spring onions, sliced, for garnish
- 1 tsp sesame seeds, toasted, for garnish
- Basmati rice

## Method

### To prepare the marinade

1. In a medium bowl combine 1 teaspoon corn flour, baking soda, 3 tablespoons soy sauce and 1 teaspoon vegetable oil. Add the sliced steak and toss to coat. Cover and set aside for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours, stored in the refrigerator.

### To prepare the sauce

1. Combine all the sauce ingredients and whisk until blended. Set aside.

### To prepare the stir-fry

1. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half the beef in a single layer, if possible, and cook until browned on one side and crisp around the edges. Turn the beef slices and continue cooking for about 2 minutes more, or until no longer pink. Remove to a plate and keep warm. Repeat with another tablespoon of oil and more sliced beef until all meat is browned.
1. Add 1 tablespoon of oil into the now-empty pan. Add the onion, carrots and broccoli and stir fry for 4-5 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and add the garlic, ginger and crushed red pepper flakes. Sauté, stirring constantly until the garlic is fragrant, about 1 minute.
1. Return the cooked beef to the skillet, along with any accumulated juices. Whisk the sauce mixture again to blend then add to the skillet. Cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce thickens, about 3 to 5 minutes.
1. Remove from the heat and serve over hot cooked rice, garnished with sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds.

## Notes

1. When adding the marinade as it heats it will thicken. If it becomes too thick add more water to reduce the thickness.
