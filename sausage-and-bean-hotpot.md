# Sausage and Bean Hotpot

A fabulous one-pot wonder for those Winter months and a recipe I have developed over many years.
This is great to quickly put together on a weeknight and how hot you make it is up to you!

Some insist on browning the sausages before adding them to the hotpot however I prefer to cook them just in the hotpot as it makes the sausage softer which works well with the hotpot.

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 60 minutes
- Total Time: 1 hour 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- Sausages (2-3 Cumberland sausages per serving)
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 2 red chilli, finely chopped
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1 chorizo, diced into lardon like cubes
- 2 tbsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1 tsp rosemary
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 crushed chicken stock cube
- 100g pearl barley
- 50ml BBQ sauce
- 1 can of butter beans
- 1 can of kidney beans
- 1 handful cherry tomatoes
- 2 bay leaves
- Olive oil

## Method

1. Pre-heat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. For the ragÃ¹, cook off the fresh chillies, garlic cloves and onions in a oven proof casserole dish to give some colour before adding some olive oil.
3. Add the tomato puree and cook through until the onions are soft.
4. [Optional] If you're going for the hot hotpot variant, add the chorizo, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and cook for a few minutes.
5. Mix in the thyme, rosemary and chicken stock.
6. Stir in the BBQ sauce and add the cherry tomatoes.
7. Add the pearl barley, kidney beans, butter beans and the can tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes.
8. Add the sausages (either whole or chopped, I prefer whole) and cook in the oven for 45 mins at 180Â°C.
9. [Optional] Warm the sough dough in the oven ahead of serving.
10. Remove the dish from the oven and deglaze the pan with some water if necessary.
11. Before serving, add a few drops of balsamic vinegar.
12. Serve hot with the warm sough dough.

## Notes

1. I love the smokiness Jack Daniels BBQ sauce adds
1. Optional serve with warm sourdough loaf
