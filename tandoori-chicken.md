# Tandoori chicken

- Serves: 2-3 servings
- Prep Time: 15 minutes + 24-36 hour marinade
- Cook Time: 10 minutes
- Total Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2-3 boneless skinless chicken breasts
- 4-5 boneless skinless chicken thighs 
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 2 onions, quartered and layers separated
- vegetable oil, for brushing

### Marinade

- 300ml Greek yoghurt
- large piece ginger, grated
- 4 garlic cloves, crushed
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 lemon or lime
- 1 tsp turmeric powder
- 1 tsp extra hot chilli powder
- 2 tbsp tandoori masala powder
- 1 tbsp cumin powder
- 1 tbsp coriander powder
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tsp ground pepper
- 1 tsp citrus powder
- Fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped
- Red food colouring powder (optional - while this adds no flavour benefit it does make a huge visual difference to the dish)

## Method

1. Mix together all the dry marinade ingredients (excluding the red food colouring) before adding the other yoghurt.
2.Thoroughly mix together and then gradually add red food colouring until you get to a consistent red colour throughout the marinade.
3. Place the chicken either in a large bowl or zip lock bag and carefully add the marinade. Ensure the chicken is mixed around so it gets a good covering of marinade.
4. Allow the marinate overnight or 24 hours for best results.
5. Heat the pizza oven and cast iron dish.
6. Once at temperature remove the cast iron dish and use tongs to remove the chicken from the marinade and into the cast iron dish. You should get a wonderful sizzling effect when the chicken hits the dish.
7. Place cast iron dish back into the heat and cook for 3-4 minutes.
8. Remove and turn the chicken and cook for a further 3-4 minutes.
9. At this stage now is the time to bake any naans (#291) you may be cooking.
10. Remove the pan and place the quartered onion pieces into the pan with a little oil drizzled over them with the chicken placed on top.
11. Cook for a few more minutes until the onion is nicely charred. 
12. Serve in the cast iron pan on a suitable wooden board that can take the heat.
