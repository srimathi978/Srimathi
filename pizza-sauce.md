# Pizza sauce

## Ingredients

- 400g San Marsano tomatoes (some use passata others use can of tomatoes, a purist will say San Marsano tomatoes)
- Seasoning salt, white pepper, and crushed black pepper
- 1 tsp sugar
- 2 or 3 garlic cloves, crushed or finely chopped 
- Fresh basil (leaves and stalks), finely chopped

## Method

1. Sauté garlic, fresh basil (and finely diced onion) in some olive oil until soft 
1. Add the tomatoes and the sugar (2 tsp)
1. Use a potato masher or fork to crush the tomatoes (don't blend as the texture can become mousse-like)
1. Simmer for 15-20 minutes until thickened.

## Notes

1. A splash of balsamic glaze is quite nice.
