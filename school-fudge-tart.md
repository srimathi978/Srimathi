# School fudge tart

A classic from school. One that I have thought I many times.

## Ingredients

### Pastry

- 170g plain flour
- 85g butter
- (original recipe states 1 ½oz marg, 1 ½oz lard/ shortening)
- 45ml water.

### Filling

- 285ml milk
- 85g sugar
- 115g butter
- 60g plain flour
- 1 tsp vanilla essence
- 15g chocolate, grated

## Method

1. Makeup pastry as normal – new bakers can use the BBC recipe here – then line and grease 8″ flan tin.
2. Bake blind for 15 minutes at 180ºC.
3. Pour half the milk into a saucepan, add butter and heat till nearly boiling.
4. While you wait, blend the remainder of milk with the flour and beat to a smooth paste.
5. Add the flour/milk paste to the hot milk mixture, quickly add the sugar and cook thoroughly (stir and stir and stir) until a thick smooth finish is obtained.
6. Add the vanilla essence and beat through.
7. Pour in the pastry case and leave to cool.
8. Decorate with the grated chocolate.

## Notes

1. Serve with hot or cold custard.
