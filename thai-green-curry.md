# Thai green curry

I remember the first time I had a prawn Thai green curry like it was yesterday. With this recipe, I'm instantly taken back to the [The Wrestlers](https://www.squaremeal.co.uk/restaurants/the-wrestlers-cambridge_8507) on Newmarket Road in Cambridge. A team of us from the IT department at Marshall Aerospace regularly visited there for lunch at least once a month! For me, I'm reminded of the intensity of the curry paste and chilli's, the sweetness and smoothness of the coconut milk, the stickiness of the rice served separately in a bowl and the aubergine that has stuck with me since. They also provided chilli prawn crackers with the dish, which were delicious.

Among the countless recipes I've tried, this is the one I default to each time I cook a Thai green curry. I like it hot, but you can make it as hot or mild as you like. Some like it with prawns while others like it with chicken. This recipe and my katsu curry recipe inspired me to track down a utensil that I have seen used in restaurants like Wagamama, among others, to mould the sticky rice when served. After much research, I finally found the name of the utensil. It is known as a Shimotori (Omurice) rice mould, and I brought one from [Global Kitchen Japan](https://www.globalkitchenjapan.com/collections/shimotori/products/shimotori-stainless-steel-restaurant-style-rice-mold-omurice). This adds a lovely touch when serving the dish.

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 30 minutes
- Total Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp green curry paste
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 can coconut milk
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 1 tbsp palm sugar
- Red chillies to taste
- 1 lime, juice of
- 8 Thai basil leaves
- 1 small can of bamboo shoots drained
- Fresh lemongrass sticks, finely chopped
- 600g king prawns, shelled, optional depending on prawn or chicken variation
- 2 chicken breasts or thighs, optional depending on prawn or chicken variation
- Sliced aubergine
- 150g sticky rice, 75g of rice per person
- Prawn crackers, to serve

## Method

1. Heat the oils in a large heavy bottom pan and stir in the curry paste for 1-2 minutes. Careful the heat is not too hot that it burns the curry paste.
1. Add the coconut milk, lime leaves, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, zest and simmer for 10-15 minutes. This is the points where you can add more green curry paste or coconut milk depending on your preference. If I add more of both I often add a little more palm sugar and lime.
1. Complete the sauce by adding the chilli's, aubergine and bamboo shoots.
1. Boil water and add sticky rice following the cooking instructions on the packet.
1. In a separate pan, cook the prawns or chicken breast (diced).
1. Throw in the torn Thai basil leaves and stir.
1. Serve the sticky rice (separately or using the Shimotori mould) before placing the prawn or chicken over the rice or in a bowl.
1. Pour the curry over the prawn or chicken.
