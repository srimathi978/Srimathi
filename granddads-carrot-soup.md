# Granddads carrot soup

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 45 minutes
- Total Time: 1 hour

## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp butter
- 450g carrots, peeled and grated
- 220g potatoes, peeled and diced
- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 850ml vegetable stock
- 2 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp of Paprika
- 2 tbsp double cream
- 1 tbsp of fennel seeds

## Method

1. In a medium saucepan melt the butter over moderate heat.
2. Reduce the heat to low and sweat of the chopped onions.
3. Add the carrots and potatoes and cook for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent the vegetables from sticking to the pan.
4. Add the fennel seeds and optionally the paprika to add a slightly smoky taste to the soup.
5. Pour in the vegetable stock and simmer for a further 20 minutes, or until the vegetables are soft.
6. Season to taste with the salt and white pepper
7. Remove the pan from the heat and either press the carrot soup through a strainer placed over a medium-sized mixing bowl or alternatively use a blender directly in the pan. I prefer a hand blender and keeping all the vegetable in the soup. Straining makes the soup much thinner. 
8. Return the pan to a simmer uncovered on a low heat.
9. Stir in the cream and add more seasoning if necessary.
10. Serve Grandads Carrot Soup in bowls with a swirl of cream and sprinkle of fennel seeds.
