# Toad in the hole

This is a very classic British dish and simply classic. For the best results make the batter ahead of time and place it in the fridge for a few hours so when it hits the smoking hot oil. This creates the best crispy batter. 

Every time I make batter either for this dish or for Yorkshire puddings (#294) I am reminded of my father removing the most hottest baking tray of oil from the oven and then the sizzling sounds of the cold batter being poured into the tray.

- Serves: 3
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 25 minutes
- Total Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

- 6 best butchers sausages, I love using big Cumberland's
- 3 eggs
- 120g flour
- 120ml milk
- 1 tbsp mustard powder
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1 tsp dried rosemary
- 150ml beef gravy stock
- 2 large white onions
- Balsamic vinegar
- 100ml red wine
- Garden peas
- Fresh rosemary
- Cooking oil

## Method

1. Preheat the over to 225Â°C.
1. Brown off the sausages in a frying pan.
1. While the sausages are browning, add 3-4 tbsp of oil to a casserole dish and add to the oven to get it smoking hot.
1. Prepare the batter by mixing the eggs and flour together.
1. Add the milk, mustard powder, rosemary, paprika and seasoning to taste.
1. Remove the casserole dish from the oven (ensure it goes on a heat proof surface).
1. Quickly place the sausages into the casserole dish.
1. Pour the batter around the sizzling hot tray and topping with rosemary.
1. Return back to the oven for 25 minutes.
1. The trick for a crispy batter is to not open the oven until the batter is cooked.
1. Finely chop the onion and add to a pan with some oil or butter to sweat off.
1. Keep stirring them to prevent them from burning.
1. Once the onions have caramelised, add some flour and mix around and then reduce the red wine in a pan.
1. Add the gravy and bring to a simmer.
1. Mix in a few splashes of balsamic vinegar to the gravy.
1. Ahead of serving bring water in a pan to a boil to cook the peas.
17. Serve with gravy and peas.
