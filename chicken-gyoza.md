- Prep Time: 30 minutes
- Cook Time: 10 minutes
- Total Time: 40 minutes

## Ingredients

### Wrappers

- 270g plain flour
- ¬Ω tsp salt
- 120ml hot water

### Chicken and cabbage filling

- 110g Chinese leaf
- 150g cabbage
- 100g canned water chestnuts, drained
- 250g chicken thighs, skinless and boneless, minced
- 25g chives, finely chopped
- 25g cornflour
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp caster sugar
- Pinch of salt and white pepper
- Vegetable oil, for frying

### Gyoza sauce (makes 350ml)

- 1 large garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped
- 1 large red chilli, trimmed and finely chopped
- Salt
- 25g (1oz) sugar
- 100ml (3 1/2fl oz) malt vinegar
- 250ml (9fl oz) light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp sesame oil

## Method

### Wrappers

1. In a bowl, mix together flour and salt. Then, add water and mix with a wooden spoon/spatula.
2. With your hands, start forming dough. It will be hard at the beginning but keep kneading (you can transfer the mixture onto a worktop if it‚Äôs easier for you). It will take about 5-7 minutes to knead into a ball. The dough will be flaky at first, but it just needs more kneading.
3. When ready, place it in a plastic bag or cover in plastic wrap and let rest for 15 minutes (or longer) on your kitchen counter.
4. Divide the dough into 2 equal pieces. Put one piece back in the bag. Roll the other half until thin. You should not need a lot of flour for dusting.

### Chicken and cabbage filling

1. Skin and bone the chicken thighs, then chop them into cubes or blitz briefly in a food processor.
2. Put the Chinese leaf, cabbage and water chestnuts in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped but not pureed. 
3. Using a clean tea towel, squeeze the mixture gently but firmly to remove excess moisture, then tip into a bowl and add the minced chicken, chives, cornflour, sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sugar, salt and white pepper.

### Sauce

1. For the sauce, mash the garlic and chilli together with a little salt with the side of your knife to form a paste. 
2. Dissolve the sugar in the vinegar in a small pan over a low heat. 
3. Combine everything and serve with gyozas.

### Filling and folding the Gyoza

1. Put a teaspoon of the mixture in the centre of each gyoza skin. 
2. Moisten one of the edges with a little water, then fold over to create a half-moon shape. 
3. Press down, to form a neat crescent.

### Cooking the Gyozas

1. Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes or until hot and almost smoking and add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil. 
2. Put 3 or 4 of the dumplings in the pan and saut√© gently for 2 minutes over a low heat until they just start to brown. 
3. Don't be tempted to overcrowd the pan or they will stew.
4. Remove the pan from the heat, add 3 tablespoons of water and cover immediately with a lid of with aluminium foil. 
5. Return to the heat for 1 minute, then remove and set aside for a further 2 minutes by which time the gyozas will be heated through. 
6. Repeat for the remaining gyozas.
