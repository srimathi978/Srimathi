# Classic duck breast

This is a wonderful dish for a quick week night meal. It doesn't get simpler or nicer than pan fried duck with buttery mash potato and some creamed leak and green beans. 

## Ingredients

- 2 duck breast fillets
- Seasoning, to taste

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
2. Crosshatch score the skin and fat. Don't score so deep you cut the meat.
3. Season both sides of the duck.
4. Place skin down into a cold pan and bring the pan up to medium to low heat (6-8 minutes). This renders out the fat.
5. As the duck cooks, tilt the pan and remove any excess oil for a more consistent cook. If you're cooking mash, add the oil t the potato once mashed.
6. Turn the fillets and cook the other side for about a 1 minute.
7. Place skin down and continue cook in the oven (~4 minutes) until the internal temperature of the duck reads 52Â°C (medium-rare).
8. Remove the duck from the oven and allow to rest (~5 minutes).
9. Cut the duck breast at an angle and plate over hot mash and a side of creamed greens.

## Notes

1. Serve with creamed greens #364 and a buttery mash #280 or alternatively asparagus when in season and a red wine jus #366.
