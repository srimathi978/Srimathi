# Strawberry and Banana dessert pizza with a cookie base 

This is a dessert pizza I have gradually perfected while learning to cook pizza with my Ooni pizza oven. See my recent cooks at the bottom to see how I've perfected this amazing dessert pizza. The chocolate stuffed crust is the perfect way to finish off a slice of heaven.

## Ingredients

- 1 pizza dough base, prepared
- 1 banana, sliced,
- Strawberries, sliced
- Dairy Milk chocolate bar, broken into pieces
- Jar of Trader Joe's Speculoos Crunchy Cookie Butter or Lotus Biscuit Spread Crunchy (Nutella works too)
- Crushed cookies or Biscoff biscuits (optional)
- Drizzle of honey or maple syrup (optional)
- Icing sugar, to finish

## Method

1. Preheat the pizza oven to 400¬∞C.
1. Roll out the dough and add a piece of chocolate around the outside, then fold the dough over to form a chocolate stuffed crust.
1. Melt 1-2tbsp of cookie butter or biscuit spread in a bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds or enough to make it soft to spread over the pizza dough.
1. Once melted, spread the cookie dough over the pizza base.
1. Slice the banana and strawberries as desired and place across the pizza evenly.
1. Top with sprinkles of crushed biscuits.
1. Turn off the flame in the pizza oven ahead of launching.
1. Allow the base to cook slowly before turning the flame back on to bake the top and crust.
