# Crispy beef with egg fried rice

This one has taken me a while to perfect. The trick for me has been getting a professional steel wok and cooking the beef in batches in hot oil for long enough. My previous wok was cast iron and impossible to wok toss due the weight of it.

It's always been one of my favourites when ordering Chinese takeout but this version of the recipe leaves me feeling less stodgy and wanting more!

- Serves: 2 servings
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 5 minutes
- Total Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

### Egg Fried Rice

- Day-old cooked rice (100g per person) 
- Egg, whisked in a bowl (one egg per person)
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce

### Beef

- Oil, for frying
- Sirloin steak, cut into thin strips (freeze the steak ahead of cutting to make it easier to cut into thin strips)
- Cornflour, the more cornflour you use the better the coating you'll get on the beef
- Seasoning, to taste

### Sauce

- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 6 tbsp black rice vinegar
- 4 tbsp honey
- 4 tbsp ketchup
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp sesame seeds, to garnish

### Toppings

- 2 tbsp fresh ginger, minced or chopped finely
- 3 garlic cloves, minced or chopped finely
- 3-4 spring onions, chopped finely
- 1-2 red chilli, sliced finely
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp soy sauce

## Method

1. Heat the oil, aim for 180¬∞C.
2. Prep all the ingredients and form a wok clock plate.
3. Add the salt and pepper seasoning to the cornflour.
4. Add the beef strips to the cornflour and mix around until well coated.
5. Fry the beef strips for 1-2 minutes.
6. Remove the beef from the oil and place it on a kitchen towel to remove excess oil.
7. Allow the oil to heat up again for a second fry.
8. Add the beef strips to the hot oil for a further 2 minutes again. Remove and place onto a fresh paper towel.
9. In a hot wok, add a dash of sesame oil and the egg shortly after.
10. Allow the egg to cook slightly before moving up the side of the work.
11. Add the rice to the work, then shortly after, add some soy sauce and sesame oil.
12. Mix together and allow the rice to fry. It should start to jump in the work once ready.
13. Serve the rice into bowls before heating the wok.
14. In a hot wok, add the toppings and cook for a minute before adding the sesame oil and soy sauce mix to the wok.
15. Add the cooked beef and mix it together.
16. Slowly add more of the sauce while wok tossing. 
16. Keep adding the sauce until the beef is well glazed but not overglazed.
17. Serve the beef on top of the rice and finish with a few sesame seeds.
