# Prawn Pad Thai

I worked at a family run business that arranged a weekly team lunch where we would all come together once a week and have lunch together. It was a great opportunity to explore different foods but also come together and share different stories.
One of my all-time favourites was the Thai food from a local restaurant a few minutes away from the office. 
The chef and restaurant owner cooked this incredible Prawn Pad Thai, while this is not her recipe I always think of her dish and the team lunches when I have eat a Prawn Pad Thai.

## Method

### Sauce

2. Add the sesame oil, rice vinegar and water and mix together until fully dissolved.

### Pad Thai

1. Soak noodles in hot water for 8-10 minutes then drain.
2. Run a drizzle of sesame oil over the noodles then dry on a tray with a towel.
3. Marinade the prawns with a pinch of salt, sugar and a drizzle of sesame oil.
4. Add cooking oil to the wok over medium high heat.
5. Add eggs straight in and scramble them up.
6. Add the garlic and fold the egg over the top.
6. Add prawns to the half-cooked eggs and cook for about 2-3 minutes until the prawns are cooked through.
7. Add the noodles and bring the egg over the top of the noodles.
8. Add the Pad Thai sauce and turn up to high heat. Mix well and cook for about a minute until the noodles take on the golden brown colour.
9. Turn off the heat and add beansprouts and chives; the heat from the noodles will cook them just right.
