# Sticky salmon with broccoli

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 5 minutes
- Cook Time: 17 minutes
- Total Time: 22 minutes

## Ingredients

- 2 heads of broccoli, broken into florets, sliced in half
- 1 tsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 tbsp dark soy
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tsp garlic paste
- 1 tsp ginger paste
- Salmon fillets
- Spring onions, finely sliced, to serve
- Serve with hot or cold rice

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200¬∞C.
2. Place the broccoli florets into a baking dish, drizzle over the sesame oil and toss the broccoli around to coat it in the oil. Pop into the oven and bake for 5 minutes.
3. Meanwhile, make up the sauce in a small bowl by mixing together the soy sauce, honey, garlic and ginger.
4. After 5 minutes, remove the broccoli from the oven and give it a good stir around in the dish. Place the salmon fillets, skin side down, in the baking dish and spoon the sauce over each fillet, drizzling any remaining sauce over the broccoli
5. Place in the oven and cook for 12 minutes.
6. Serve, removing the skin from the salmon fillets, if you like, then scattering with the spring onions.

## Note
- You can add extra vegetables to the tray to cook if you wish at the same time as the broccoli. Onion wedges, pepper strips, cauliflower florets, green beans and asparagus spears all work well.
