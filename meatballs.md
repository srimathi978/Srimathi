# Meatballs

I have loved spaghetti and meatballs since I can remember and I think the same could be said for my daughter. She loves this recipe. Personally, I love the different variates you can find from the infamous Swedish Ikea meatballs to Turkey's Kofta - everyone has their own take on the meatball. My SO's family has a wonderful Bosnian recipe so I thought it was time I had my own.

During my quest to conquer the greatest meatball recipe I discovered the French Guy Cooking (Alex) on YouTube. His meatball series in incredible and Alex takes the [meatball recipe to another level](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLURsDaOr8hWWt59j2IJlPADnmU6SS-tEk). While Alex's recipe truly does result in the most perfect meatball there are some things that I do differently. In Alex's meatball series he points out 50% of the meatball is meat so it is really important to get blend of meat right. 

This is not my take on a perfect meatball recipe, but instead, a meatball recipe that just works! 
 
- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 20 minutes
- Total Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

- 500g minced beef
- ¬Ω onion, finely chopped
- 1 red onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic covers, crushed
- 1 tbsp dried basil
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 1 tbsp tomato pur√©e
- 2 eggs, beaten
- Seasoning, to taste
- Parmesan cheese, grated,  to serve

## Meatball Sauce

- 2 shallots
- 1 garlic
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 1tsp dried basil
- 1 can chopped tomatoes
- 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 220¬∞C.
2. Cook off the onions and garlic in some butter and set aside to cool.
3. Once cool, mix the beef, eggs and onions together in a bowl.
4. Combine the rest of the ingredients and mix into a pate.
5. With wet hands roll into golf-ball like sized balls and place on a baking tray.
6. Optionally brown off the meatballs in a pan to give them a crispy edge - I don't as I prefer a softer meatball.
7. Cook the meatballs in the pre-heated oven for 18 minutes. No opening to peek but don't over cook them. Remember we want a moist centre.
8. While the meatballs are cooking prepare the sauce and spaghetti.

### Spaghetti and sauce

9. Cook the spaghetti as per the packets instructions.
10. For the sauce, cook off the remaining onions and garlic in some butter. 
11. Once the onions have browned off, add the tomato puree and basil and cook for a further 3 minutes.
12. Add the can of tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and simmer to reduce for 15 minutes.
13. Serve the drained spaghetti, pour over some of the sauce and top with the meatballs and a grating of fresh parmesan cheese.

## Notes

1. You'll note the meatball sauce #145 is very similar to my pizza sauce.
