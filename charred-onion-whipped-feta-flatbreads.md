# Charred onion & whipped feta flatbreads

- Serves: 4 servings
- Prep Time: 25 minutes
- Cook Time: 45 minutes
- Total Time: 1 hour 10 minutes

## Ingredients

- 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
- 7g fast-action dried yeast
- 70ml olive oil, plus extra for proving
- ½ tbsp olive oil
- 3 onions, cut into chunky wedges
- 5 thyme sprigs, plus extra leaves to serve
- 2 tbsp honey, plus extra to serve
- 100g feta
- 50g Greek yoghurt
- 2 tbsp rose harissa

## Method

1. Combine the flour, 1 tsp salt and the yeast in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, and tip in 150ml warm water and the olive oil. Mix until combined, then knead on a lightly floured surface for 10 mins. Tip into a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for at least 1 hr, or until doubled in size.
2. Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Heat the extra virgin olive oil in a frying pan over a high heat, and fry the onions for about 5 mins until beginning to char, stirring every so often. Tip the onions into a roasting tin with the thyme and honey. Roast for 15 mins until softened.
3. Crumble the feta into a bowl with the yogurt, then whisk until smooth and creamy.
4. Heat a dry frying pan over a medium heat. Divide the dough into four to six balls and roll out each into a 1cm-thick circle on a lightly floured surface. Fry, one at a time, for 2 mins on each side until cooked through and lightly charred. Top with the feta yogurt, harissa, roasted onions, a bit of extra thyme and honey, and a pinch of sea salt.
 
## Notes

1.  Grill off some chicken breast and add this with the onion and whipped feta.
