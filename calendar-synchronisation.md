# Calendar Synchronisation
This is a guide about how I synchronise issues in my [Meal Planner](https://github.com/jcallaghan/Recipes/projects/10) project to my calendar.

//TODO
- Action to create project columns
- Action to create an ICS file based on the issues (recipes) in the project.
- Action to push the ICS file to my website
- Access this ICS file in the Calendar app on Windows 11, Outlook.com, Alexa, and in Home Assistant.
