# Stuffed Bell Peppers

- Serves: 6 servings
- Prep Time: 15 minutes
- Cook Time: 30 minutes
- Total Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients

- 6 medium red bell peppers (or 3 large)
- ½ tsp salt
- 680g ground turkey
- 230g ground Italian sausage, mild or spicy
- ½ medium sweet onion, diced
- 1 garlic clove, minced
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 1 can tomato sauce
- 3 tbsp Parmesan cheese, grated
- 60g shredded mozzarella cheese

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminium foil and spray lightly with cooking spray.
2. If using large bell peppers, cut them in half from top to bottom. It using medium size bell peppers, slice off the top 1/4 of the pepper. Remove the seeds and place the peppers on the baking sheet, cut side up and salt the inside.
3. Bake for 2 to 3 minutes, then drain off any liquid and return the peppers to the baking sheet.
4. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the ground turkey, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Drain off the grease.
5. Sprinkle the basil and oregano ore on top of meat and stir. Add the spaghetti sauce 1/2 cup at a time, using just enough to completely coat the meat. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until any moisture is absorbed. Remove from the heat and stir in the Parmesan cheese.
6. Spoon the meat mixture into the bell pepper cups. Top with shredded mozzarella cheese and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until the cheese is melted and lightly browned.
