# Tomato, garlic and prawn pasta

Inspired from a holiday to Budva, Montenegro, 2022. We took a boat tour and were recommended a restaurant called [Tri Ribara](https://tri-ribara.business.site/) by the boat owner. We decided to try it and had an incredible meal! 

We started with fish p√¢t√© with some fresh bread which was incredible. My SO doesn't like p√¢t√©, but it didn't take her long to start breaking some bread and enjoying it. We also both picked the tomato, garlic, and prawn spaghetti for our main which too was delicious and is the inspiration behind this recipe.

The p√¢t√© was served with fresh bread and some garlic and parsley olive oil.
